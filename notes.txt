1. Now, that you have generated a sample env map from the given image, and also generated some augmented 
images and annotations from the sample image....now think about building a model!!! u-net or something else..
and joh bhi he woh banake train karo!

bounding box annotation use kar, YOLO (instead of U-Net) use karo for training a model, such that yeh model koi 
image le, and output mein iss image ke bounding boxes return karein

NOTE:
current files to refer in a flow:
1. dataset used: dataset_v2
2. model trained, used and envmap created: garbageDetection_v2.ipynb
3. trained model saved: model/yolov8_garbage_detection.pt
4. predicted output and resultant images in: runs folder
(the bounding box labels are not currently stored as a file, and are obtained 
and stored in a variable (temporarily) whenever image labelling is carried out)
